*An IPL Simulation Game* <br>
## Intro
Over the pandemic I got heavily interested in the online basketball manager game: Basketball GM. After countless hours of playing it, I looked to see if there were any cricket games similar to it. To my disappointment I could not find any. While there exists cricket manager games such as Cricket Captain and Cricket Coach both are significantly complex games that require attention to detail. I wanted a cricket manager game that was a bit simpler than that, and that's why I created Indian Cricket League (ICL).  
## How to Start

To start the game you have 3 different game options to choose from.
1. Start with 2021 IPL rosters *8 teams, double round robin schedule from IPL 2021* (This contains an older version of player ratings, so do not expect all features that exists in the other 2 versions to work)
2. Start with 2022 IPL rosters *10 teams, 70 game schedule from IPL 2022*
3. Start with a mega auction *10 teams, 70 game schedule from IPL 2022*
All of these modes have the same components just with different roster compositions.

## How the Auction Works

### View Rosters
On the left side of the auction screen is a drop down menu that allows you to look at the current rosters of every team in the auction. This is helpful to keep track of what players you have and also to see how much money opposing teams have left to spend.
### Player Info
Each player up for auction has all their ratings visible. There are 4 batting & bowling attributes: Batting IQ, Timing, Power, Running, Economy, Wicket Taking, Clutch, and Accuracy. All of these attributes are combined to form the batting and bowling overalls of the player. 
### What do the Buttons Mean
There are 6 different actions you can take for each player during an auction. 
#### Bid: Clicking this button allows you to place a bid on a player. When you are the last team left bidding for a player you get them.
#### Drop Bid: Click this button exits you from the auction of a player and the rest of the bids for that player is simulated.
#### Sim Player: Click this button and player auction is simulated, unlike with Drop Bid you can still get the player after clicking this button
#### Next Player: This button serves no purpose unless a glitch occurs and you can not get to the next player in an auction
#### Sim Auction: Click this button to simulate the rest of the auction.
#### Move on from Auction: Click this button to progress from the auction to the start of the season. If auction wasn't completed it will also sim the rest of the auction.
### View Auction Records
On the right side of the screen there is two lists that can be toggled between. One list showcases the names of players to come onto the auction block, and the other shows the amounts that players have sold for already in the auction.
### Messages You Might Get During Auction
During the auction eventually you may hit the international cap of 8 players. Once you hit this you will be alerted and not be able to bid on any more international players. Outside of this if you hit the roster limit of 25 players or 90 crores then the rest of the auction will be simulated.
