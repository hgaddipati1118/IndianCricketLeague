*An IPL Simulation Game* <br>
## Intro
Over the pandemic I got heavily interested in the online basketball manager game: Basketball GM. After countless hours of playing it, I looked to see if there were any cricket games similar to it. To my disappointment I could not find any. While there exists cricket manager games such as Cricket Captain and Cricket Coach both are significantly complex games that require attention to detail. I wanted a cricket manager game that was a bit simpler than that, and that's why I created Indian Cricket League (ICL).  
## How to Start

To start the game you have 3 different game options to choose from.
1. Start with 2021 IPL rosters *8 teams, double round robin schedule from IPL 2021* (This contains an older version of player ratings, so do not expect all features that exists in the other 2 versions to work)
2. Start with 2022 IPL rosters *10 teams, 70 game schedule from IPL 2022*
3. Start with a mega auction *10 teams, 70 game schedule from IPL 2022*
All of these modes have the same components just with different roster compositions.
